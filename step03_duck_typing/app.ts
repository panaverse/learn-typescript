//TypeScript doesn’t require strict datatype matching, either. 
//TypeScript uses what the specification calls “structural subtyping” to determine compatibility. 
//This is similar to what’s often called “duck typing.” 

//Added new rules for TypeScript 1.6 https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/pull/3823


//Case when "FRESH"" object literal are assigned to a variable 
//Rule: When a fresh object literal is assigned to a variable or passed for a parameter of a non-empty target type, 
//it is an error for the object literal to specify properties that don't exist in the target type.
//The rationale for the below two errors is that since the fresh types of the object literals are 
//never captured in variables, static knowledge of the excess or misspelled properties should not be silently lost. 

let myType = { name: "Zia", id: 1 };

//Case 1
myType = { id: 2,  name: "Tom" };//Case 1: can only assign a type which has the the same properties
									//Object literals can only have properties that exist in contextual type


//Case 2a
myType = { id: 2,  name_person: "Tom" };//Case 2a: Error, renamed or missing property

//Case 2b 
//A type can include an index signature to explicitly indicate that excess properties are permitted in with fresh objects:

var x: { id: number, [x: string]: any };//Note now 'x' can have any name, just that the property should be of type string
x = { id: 1, fullname: "Zia" };  // Ok, `fullname` matched by index signature


//Case 3
myType = { id: 2,  name: "Tom", age: 22 };//Case 3: Error, excess property






//Case when STALE object literal are assigned to a variable 
let myType2 = { id: 2,  name: "Tom" };
//Case 1
myType = myType2;//Case 1: can only assign a type which has the the same properties, rule same for fresh and stale object

let myType3 = { id: 2,  name_person: "Tom" };
//Case 2a
myType = myType3;//Case 2: Error, renamed or missing property, rule same for stale and fresh object 


//Case 2b
//A type can include an index signature to explicitly indicate that excess properties are permitted in with fresh objects:

var x: { id: number, [x: string]: any };//Note now 'x' can have any name, just that the property should be of type string
var y = { id: 1, fullname: "Zia" };
x = y;// Ok, `fullname` matched by index signature


var myType4 = { id: 2,  name: "Tom", age: 22 };
//Case 3
myType = myType4;//Case 3: Ok, excess property allowed in case of stale object which is different from fresh object





/*
var x: { foo: number };
x = { foo: 1, baz: 2 };  // Error, excess property `baz`

var y: { foo: number, bar?: number };
y = { foo: 1, baz: 2 };  // Error, excess or misspelled property `baz`

/


var a: { foo: number };
var a1 = { foo: 1, baz: 2 };
a = a1;//No Error

var z: { foo: number, bar?: number };
var z1 = { foo: 1, baz: 2 };
z = z1;//No Error
